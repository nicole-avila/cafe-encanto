00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You know, it's hard business farming.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And how fragile, because a bad storm can take out the season

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or a terrible civil war can ruin everything.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Nespresso has this Reviving Origins Program.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And farmers' lives have changed..

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In a big way!

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You know, Colombia is obviously famous for its coffee but also...

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
sensed a rough time over the years.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Zimbabwe, before you can actually see climate change come directly in line with conflict.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Since the hurricane in Puerto Rico, Nespresso got more involved.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Nespresso was coming and said, Look!

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We get it! We are going to grow these coffee beans that you guys know how to do so well.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And we are gonna make it even more efficient.

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And we're gonna reclaim land that had been lost.

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So that farmers themselves are able to continue working and be protected.

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And everyone that tastes it, goes -Oh...

17
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I get it...
